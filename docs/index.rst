Lightnet documentation
======================
Lightnet is a library for pytorch_, that makes it easier to create CNN's.
It was mainly created to implement darknet_ networks in python.

Credits
-------
Credits where credits are due. I get a lot *-if not most-* of my ideas from other papers and repositories. |br|
Without the work of the following people, this library would have never become a reality.

- `pjreddie et al. <darknet_>`_ for their work on the original YOLO networks
- `The PyTorch team <pytorch_>`_ for creating a clear and powerfull library for deep learning.
- `marvis <pytorch-yolo2_>`_ for his implementation of YOLO in pytorch. I took a lot of parts from this repository, and tweaked them to my needs.
- `longcw <yolo2-pytorch_>`_ for his implementation of YOLO in pytorch. I used his code to get a correct region loss.
- `Andrew G. Howard et al. <mobilenets_>`_ for their work on efficient MobileNets.
