    "# Training Engine\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to use the lightnet engine and related classes to help you setup your training more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training models with pytorch, there is quite a bit of boilerplate code that needs to be written each time.\n",
    "The [lightnet.engine](../api/engine.rst) submodule provides functionality to make it easier to setup your training pipelines and allows to easily perform the same training routine on different networks (with different losses, hyperparameters, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discuss the 2 most important classes of this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [HyperParameters](#HyperParameters): This class allows to group together all hyperparameters of a certain model, making it easier to perform the same training on various different models\n",
    "- [Engine](#Engine): This class provides basic functionality to reduce the boilerplate code needed to train a model. It has some opinionated features that make it easy to split up training in batches and even mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these 2 classes, this submodule contains a [LinePlotter](../api/engine.rst#lightnet.engine.LinePlotter) to easily plot data with visdom and a [SchedulerCompositor](../api/engine.rst#lightnet.engine.SchedulerCompositor) that allows to use multiple schedulers throughout your training pipeline."
