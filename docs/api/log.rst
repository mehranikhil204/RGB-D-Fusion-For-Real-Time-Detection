Logging
=======
This package use the standard python logging module to provide some insightfull logging information.
This page gives a basic introduction on how to use it.
For more information on loggers, you can take a look at the `official documentation`_.

Lightnet has 8 different logging levels:

- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARN
- DEPRECATED
- TEST
- TRAIN
- ERROR
- CRITICAL

``TEST`` and ``TRAIN`` are special levels that are used by the :any:`lightnet engine <lightnet.engine.Engine.log>` to differentiate when the network is in training or testing mode.

There are 2 ways to set the logging level with this package. |br|
The first is by using the ``LN_LOGLVL`` environment variable.
Setting this environment variable before running a lightnet script will force lightnet to filter out messages up to that specified level. When setting this variable to ``DEBUG``, the logging messages will print more information about the module they come from. |br|
The second method is by using the :func:`lightnet.logger.setConsoleLevel` function. This has the benefit that it is programmable, but you wont get the extra information by setting the level to ``DEBUG``.

.. rubric:: Example

>>> import sys
>>> sys.stderr.write = print  # Ignore this: for doctest only
>>> import logging
>>> 
>>> # This line will log all messages to a file.
>>> # Note: that this also saves messages from other packages using the logging module
>>> logging.basicConfig(filename='file.log', filemode='w')  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> 
>>> # This line will only log TRAIN and TEST level messages to a file
>>> # Note: this logfile will only consider messages from 'lightnet.*' loggers
>>> filehandler = ln.logger.setLogFile('file.log', levels=('TRAIN', 'TEST'), filemode='w')  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> 
>>> # Use this function to enable/disable colored terminal output
>>> ln.logger.setConsoleColor(False)
>>> 
>>> # This line enables all messages from lightnet to be printed on the console
>>> # Note: messages that were printed before this line (eg. upon loading the package) will not be printed
>>> ln.logger.setConsoleLevel(logging.NOTSET)
>>> 
>>> # If you want to use the logging module yourself, and have the same styling as the lightnet logger, use this
>>> log = logging.getLogger('lightnet.choose-a-name-here')
>>> log.debug('This is a debug message')  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
DEBUG      This is a debug message
>>> log.info('This is an info message')   #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
INFO       This is an info message
>>> log.warning('This is a warning')   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
WARNING    This is a warning
>>> log.deprecated('This is a deprecation warning')   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
DEPRECATED This is a deprecation warning
>>> log.error('This is an error')   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
ERROR      This is an error
>>> log.critical('This is a critical error') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
CRITICAL   This is a critical error
>>> log.train('This is a special logging level that prefixes the message with `TRAIN`')   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
TRAIN      This is a special logging level that prefixes the message with `TRAIN`
>>> log.test('This is a special logging level that prefixes the message with `TEST`')  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
TEST       This is a special logging level that prefixes the message with `TEST`

.. Note:: 
   On systems that do not support ANSI color codes *(mainly Windows < 10)*, the logger wil not use colors by default. |br|
   If you want colored log output on these systems, you can install the colorama_ package and use the following code:

   .. doctest:: 
      :options: +SKIP

      >>> from colorama import init
      >>> import lightnet as ln
      >>> 
      >>> init()
      >>> ln.logger.setConsoleColor(True)
