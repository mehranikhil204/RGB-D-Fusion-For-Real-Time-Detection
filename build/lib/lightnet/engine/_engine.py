class Engine(ABC):
    """ This class removes the boilerplate code needed for writing your training cycle. |br|
    Here is the code that runs when the engine is called:

    .. literalinclude:: /../lightnet/engine/_engine.py
       :language: python
       :pyobject: Engine.__call__
       :dedent: 4

    Args:
        params (lightnet.engine.HyperParameters): Serializable hyperparameters for the engine to work with
        dataloader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader, optional): Dataloader for the training data; Default **None**
        **kwargs (dict, optional): Keywords arguments that will be set as attributes of the engine

    Attributes:
        self.params: HyperParameter object
        self.dataloader: Dataloader object
        self.sigint: Boolean value indicating whether a SIGINT (CTRL+C) was send; Default **False**
        self.*: All values that were passed with the init function and all values from the :class:`~lightnet.engine.HyperParameters` can be accessed in this class

    Note:
        This class expects a `self.dataloader` object to be present. |br|
        You can either pass a dataloader when initializing this class, or you can define it yourself.
        This allows to define `self.dataloader` as a computed property (@property) of your class, opening up a number of different possibilities,
        like eg. computing different dataloaders depending on which epoch you are.

    Note:
        This engine allows to define hook functions to run at certain points in the training *(epoch_start, epoch_end, batch_start, batch_end)*.
        The functions can be defined as class methods of your engine without any extra arguments or as separate functions that take the engine as a single argument.

        There are different functions to register a hook and they can be used as decorator functions or called straight away in code:

        ...     def start(self):
        ...         pass

        ...

        ...     def update_hyperparams(self):
        ...         pass    # This method will be executed at the start of every 100th batch
        ...
        >>> # Create TrainingEngine object and run it

        >>> def backup(engine):
        ...     pass    # This function will be executed at the end of every Xth batch defined by a backup_rate variable at runtime
